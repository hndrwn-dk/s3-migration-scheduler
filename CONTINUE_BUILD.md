# 🚀 Continue Your Windows Build

## ✅ **Perfect! You're in Great Shape**

- ✅ SQLite dependency removed successfully
- ✅ Dependencies installed without errors
- ✅ Ready to build Windows application

## 🎯 **Continue From Where You Are**

Since the dependencies are now installed without SQLite issues, run these commands:

```powershell
# Go to electron-app directory
PS C:\Users\hendr\Deployment\s3-migration-scheduler> cd electron-app

# Verify frontend build exists and copy if needed
PS C:\Users\hendr\Deployment\s3-migration-scheduler\electron-app> if (!(Test-Path "build")) { Copy-Item -Recurse ..\client\build .\build }

# Build Windows application
PS C:\Users\hendr\Deployment\s3-migration-scheduler\electron-app> npx electron-builder --win
```

## ⏱️ **Expected Process**

The build will take 5-10 minutes and show:
```
Building target nsis in directory dist
Building target portable in directory dist
...
Build completed successfully!
```

## 📦 **Expected Results**

You'll get these files in `electron-app\dist\`:
```
├── S3 Migration Scheduler Setup 1.0.0.exe  (Professional installer)
├── S3 Migration Scheduler-1.0.0.exe       (Portable version)
├── latest.yml                              (Auto-update metadata)
└── win-unpacked\                           (Raw application files)
```

## 🎉 **You're Almost There!**

The hard part (SQLite dependency issues) is solved. Now just run the electron-builder command!

```powershell
cd electron-app
npx electron-builder --win
```
